This repository includes my Java introductory training works.

I followed the program path "Java ile Programlamaya Giriş" course (https://www.btkakademi.gov.tr/portal/course/java-ile-programlamaya-giris-9617) by Engin Demiroğ in BTK Akademi.

* inheritance
* inheritanceDemo
* polymorphism
    * There are two types of polymorphism in OOP. Compile-time and run-time polymorphism. 

      Compile-time polymorphism is overloading, which is made with the same-named method, but has a different parameter list. Return type conversion cannot be done with the same parameter list since the signature of the methods will be the same due to the same parameter list.

      The return type cannot be changed with the same parameter list by overloading. Because the signatures of the methods would be exactly the same with the same parameter list.

      Run-time polymorphism is overriding, which is made with the same-named base class method in the derived class. The overridden method has the same parameter list. However, it allows us to make different operations.

* abstractClasses
    * Abstract classes cannot be instantiated on their own.

      Abstract classes may contain abstract methods. Subclasses that extend an abstract class must provide implementations for all the abstract methods or be declared as abstract classes themselves.

      Abstract classes are often used to define a common interface or behavior that multiple subclasses share. They provide a way to partially implement a class and leave some methods for the subclasses to implement based on their specific needs.
